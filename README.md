# Laptop Prices
Hello, <br />
I have decided to try and create my first own project on data analysis. As I wanted to create something that would be functioning also as useful for at least <br />someone, I chose to analyze gaming
laptops. To create my base dataset I needed to scrape some webs with gaming laptops. First scraped website was Alza.cz(https://www.alza.cz).
Second website I wanted to scrape was CZC.cz(https://www.czc.cz). I chose these two, because I live in the Czech Republic and these are 
the most common websites for buying digital accessories. 
<br />
<br />
I built my own web scraper using scrapy package in python. Many videos helped me to understand how scrapy works as it was also my first time trying this. 
I have decided to include some of the most useful sources in the description.
